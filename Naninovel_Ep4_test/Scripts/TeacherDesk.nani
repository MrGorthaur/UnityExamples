...I walked up to Mr. Harrelson's desk and turned in my dripping essay.
@print "I'm sorry about that. I was trying to do the best I can. But maybe luck is not on my side." author:Mia
@print "I'm sorry too. But there will be lots of competitions to follow. You're sure to win one." author:Adam

#Then
@print "I meant to ask you, did you read the book I recommended? Did anything you read there come in handy today?" author:Adam
...It would have been embarrassing to admit that I fell asleep each time I attempted to read it.
@print "Not yet... I mean, I checked the book out, but... There's so much in there, I haven't really grasped it yet..." author:Mia
...Mr. Harrelson kept peering at me closely.
@print "No wonder. This book, how should I say this, is of profound depth and contains many layers of knowledge. Well, I hope you continue working with it." author:Adam
...I nodded and turned toward the exit. Mr. Harrelson called out to me.
@print "[NAME], how would you like to grab some dinner and talk things over? " author:Adam
...I felt blood rushing to my face. Was flirting with me?? That wouldn't be right... Would it?
@print "I suggest we meet at Green Square Cafe here on campus. I'd be happy to tell you a bit about my scientific discoveries...and learn more about your plans with regard to science and learning." author:Adam

...I figured Mr. Harrelson probably needed a research assistant or something, and I looked like a promising student to him. It was stupid to think he was flirting. But the idea of spending some time with him sounded so nice...
@print "Sure. When is a good time for you?" author:Mia
...Mr. Harrelson briefly checked the calendar in his phone.
@print " Six o'clock. Can you make it?" author:Adam
...Our eyes were locked...I couldn't look away. It felt like his eyes are pulling me in...
@print "I'm sorry" author:Mia
@print "So, six o'clock at Green Square?" author:Adam
@print "Yup. See you there!" author:Mia
...Mr. Harrelson nodded and started packing up the student essays. I walked out of the classroom.

ADAM IS GRATEFUL FOR YOUR TRUST

...This felt very odd. I was not about to engage in some kind of an "extracurricular" relationship with a prof.
@print "I'm sorry. I can't today. Or at all, actually..." author:Mia
@print "No, I'm sorry. I think I scared you a bit. Actually, it's quite common for a professor to try to get to know promising students that might advance science... I do believe that you could write a fantastic " author:Adam
...I felt like a total idiot. What was I thinking! Mr. Harrelson could not possibly be attracted to me! This was purely a scientific proposal, a learning opportunity!
@print "Hmm...I think I could reschedule my plans. What should I prepare for the dinner?" author:Mia
...My question seemed to amuse him, and I felt embarrassed again.
@print "Well... I mean, prepare to discuss a specific topic. Maybe I should bring my notes..." author:Mia
@print "You don't need to. We'll just talk and find some junction points where our opinions and interests intersect." author:Adam
@print "Sure. Ok. Great!" author:Mia
@print "So, six o'clock at Green Square?" author:Adam
@print "Yup. See you there!" author:Mia
...Mr. Harrelson nodded and started packing up the student essays. I walked out of the classroom, my face burning.
