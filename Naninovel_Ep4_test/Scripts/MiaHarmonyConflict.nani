...There were some nasty chuckles in the classroom. Then Mr. Harrelson raised his voice.
@print text:"Quiet, class! [NAME], whatever the nature of your problem, I'm giving you extra time. So don't worry." author:Adam
...Neo grimaced. I had to start over.

...I wasn't sure what to do. If I exposed Harmony because of the coffee, I'd become a walking cringe. But was there enough time to rewrite the essay?
@print text:"MIA: I'm sorry, Professor. I got distracted and caused this to happen myself." author:Mia

@print "Mr. Harrelson, it was my fault. I deliberately spilled my coffee on [NAME]'s essay. I'm sorry, [NAME]!" author:Harmony
...Neo jumped. The room fell silent. But Mr. Harrelson wasn't looking at Harmony, he fixed his gaze on me. He looked both intrigued and perplexed.

@print "That's nice to hear, Miss Harmony. Not that you did it, but that you had the courage to own up to it. I don't think anyone would object to [NAME] taking some extra time to rewrite her essay, given the circumstances." author:Adam
@print "What'd you do that for??" author:Neo
...Harmony stared at him, confused.
@print "What do you mean?" author:Harmony
@print "Why did you admit spilling the stupid coffee?" author:Neo
@print "Have you gone mad?? I admitted no such thing!" author:Harmony
@print " Now you're being plain scary. I think you need to see a doctor." author:Neo

...I figured the only sensible thing left for me to do was to ask Mr. Harrelson to give me more time to rewrite the essay.
@print "I'm sorry this happened. Can I ask for extra time to rewrite the whole thing? " author:Mia
@print "I'm sorry, [NAME]. You'll just have to turn it in as it is." author:Adam
...I was devastated. The essay turned out to be a waste of time and effort. I wasn't going to get that internship. 
@print "Well, good luck I guess. I bet you're going to win." author:Neo
...Oddly, for a split second it seemed like Neo was not happy about how things turned out.
